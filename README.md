A repository for software and code to cover democracy at all levels. Started by [Aaron Williams](twitter.com/aboutaaron) and (Steven Rich)[twitter.com/dataeditor] at [SRCCON 2017](http://schedule.srccon.org/#_session-practical-software-democracy), This will serve as a place for folks to put useful code for covering local, state, federal and international governments.
